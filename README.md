Bot for twitter that processes images.

Works with https://github.com/quinor/tspart for image filters.

## Installation/usage:

1. (optional) create virtualenv for the project
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. install tspart
4. copy settings.py.template to settings.py and fill it (you'll need twitter
   account API keys)
5. start.sh/stop.sh for controlling the app

In case of problems, contact me on github.
